In genomics workflows, that often translates into:\\n\" + \"• Converting a research goal into a structured analysis checklist\\n\" + \"• Drafting pipeline skeletons (folder structure, config files, command templates)\\n\" + \"• Explaining what common metrics mean (mapping rate, duplication, mitochondrial %, etc.)\\n\" + \"• Summarizing outputs into short, human-readable notes for lab updates\\n\\n\" + \"🧬 WHERE LLMs CAN HELP ACROSS A TYPICAL PIPELINE\\n\" + \"1) STUDY SETUP & METADATA\\n\" + \"• Helping clean sample metadata tables (consistent naming, group labels)\\n\" + \"• Suggesting a clear comparison structure (treated vs control, paired design)\\n\" + \"• Flagging missing fields that will matter later (batch, replicate, timepoint)\\n\\n\" + \"2) QC INTERPRETATION\\n\" + \"LLMs can help you interpret QC patterns, for example:\\n\" + \"• Low mapping + high rRNA reads → possible contamination or reference mismatch\\n\" + \"• High duplication → low complexity library or over-amplification\\n\" + \"• High mitochondrial % in scRNA-seq → stressed/dying cells or dissociation artifacts\\n\" + \"This is useful because QC reports contain many metrics, and beginners often don’t know what matters most.\\n\\n\" + \"3) ASSISTING DOWNSTREAM NARRATIVE\\n\" + \"After differential expression or clustering, an LLM can help:\\n\" + \"• Summarize marker genes into likely cell type labels (with references to known markers)\\n\" + \"• Convert enrichment outputs into biologically meaningful statements\\n\" + \"• Draft “Results” bullets for a slide deck or portfolio page\\n\\n\" + \"⚙️ WHAT LLMs SHOULD NOT DO (WITHOUT CAREFUL REVIEW)\\n\" + \"• Final scientific decisions (e.g., declaring a pathway is “important” without context)\\n\" + \"• Interpreting results without checking experimental design and confounders\\n\" + \"• Producing ‘confident’ statements without evidence or validation\\n\" + \"• Replacing domain checks like: known markers, controls, replicate consistency\\n\\n\" + \"✅ HOW TO USE LLMs SAFELY (A SIMPLE WORKFLOW)\\n\" + \"Step 1: Use LLMs to draft and organize (templates, checklists, documentation)\\n\" + \"Step 2: Run real tools for the analysis (STAR/Salmon/Scanpy/Seurat, etc.)\\n\" + \"Step 3: Validate results using biology + QC + known references\\n\" + \"Step 4: Use the LLM again to help write a clean summary of what you verified\\n\\n\" + \"📌 TAKEAWAY\\n\" + \"LLMs are best used as a co-pilot for structuring workflows and communicating results.
